Jehan is the Founder and Director at Theatre Professionals.
<br/><br/>

Jehan Manekshaw has a Master of Fine Arts in Theatre Direction from the University of London and a Bachelor of Arts in Theatre from Wesleyan University, CT, USA.
<br/>

Since founding Theatre Professionals in 2008, Jehan has conducted numerous workshops for professional actors, children, and corporate.  He has evolved a number of methodologies and a strong process for identifying how to best utilize drama practices for the learning and development of any participant group.
<br/><br/><br/>
Jehan has been a guest faculty at Ninsasam Theatre Institute, Attakallari Centre for Movement Arts and St Xaviers College, Mumbai. Jehan’s focus on pedagogical practice and process has most recently culminated in the fourth Intensive Drama Programme for Professional Actors. One of the most intensive short course programmes available in the country today; a programme which brings theatre masters from highly diverse backgrounds such as Kerala, Manipur, London, Latin America, to collaborate together and deliver a cohesive learning experience based on a common goal.

While he has directed many plays in his career, he also works with teams across languages and cultures, most recently directing Shakespeare’s Othello in Kannada at the Ninasam Theatre Institute in Karnataka and Eklavya in Japanese at the Matsumoto Performing Arts Centre, in Japan.
